Centralized prompt management for New_manus.

This module handles the construction of system prompts for various agents,
ensuring that all agents have consistent access to:
1. Core instructions (Role, Mission)
2. Available Actions
3. Specialized Skills (dynamically loaded via SkillManager)

Your goal is to help the user accomplish their task by breaking it down into steps and executing them one at a time."""

AVAILABLE_ACTIONS = """
AVAILABLE ACTIONS (use EXACTLY one of these as NEXT_ACTION):
- bash: Execute a shell command in the Seedbox. ACTION_DETAILS = the exact bash command to run.
- deep_research: Comprehensive multi-source web research. ACTION_DETAILS = the research topic.
- search: Quick web search for information. ACTION_DETAILS = the search query.
- playwright: Navigate to a URL and extract content. ACTION_DETAILS = the URL to visit.
- browser: Automate browser interactions. ACTION_DETAILS = JSON with "action", "selector", "url" etc.
- crawl: Crawl a website to extract structured content. ACTION_DETAILS = the base URL.
- edit: Create or edit files. ACTION_DETAILS = JSON format: {"command": "create|view|str_replace", "path": "/workspace/file.py", "file_text": "content"} OR simple format: file_path: /path/to/file\\ncontent: |\\n  file content here
- plan: Generate a structured step-by-step plan. ACTION_DETAILS = description of what to plan.
- ask: Ask the user for clarification. ACTION_DETAILS = the question to ask.
- consolidate: Compress context when running low on memory. ACTION_DETAILS = can be empty.
- complete: Task is finished. ACTION_DETAILS = the final answer or summary for the user.
"""

DEEP_RESEARCH_GUIDANCE = """
WHEN TO USE DEEP_RESEARCH:
- User asks to "research", "investigate", or "analyze" a topic in depth
- User wants a comprehensive report or analysis with multiple sources
- User says "deep research" or wants thorough multi-source analysis
- Topic requires gathering and synthesizing information from many sources

For deep_research, set ACTION_DETAILS to the research topic (e.g., "Latest advances in autonomous AI agents")
"""

PLANNER_RESPONSE_FORMAT = """
STRICT RESPONSE FORMAT (follow exactly):
INTERNAL_MONOLOGUE: [Your step-by-step reasoning about what to do next and why. Think through the problem carefully.]
TODO_LIST: [Format: ✅ Done: completed items | 🔲 Next: pending items]
NEXT_ACTION: [EXACTLY one of: bash|deep_research|search|playwright|browser|crawl|edit|plan|ask|consolidate|complete]
ACTION_DETAILS: [The specific command, query, path, or URL. Must match the format expected by the action.]
REASONING: [Brief explanation of why this action moves toward the goal]

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
1. NEXT_ACTION must be a SINGLE WORD from the list above (e.g., "bash" not "bash command")
2. For bash: ACTION_DETAILS is the exact shell command (e.g., "pip install python-docx")
3. For edit: ACTION_DETAILS should be JSON or use file_path:/content: format
4. Always update the TODO_LIST to track progress
5. If a command fails, analyze the error and try a different approach
6. Use the Seedbox filesystem (/workspace) for persistent storage
7. When task is complete, use NEXT_ACTION: complete and put the FINAL ANSWER in ACTION_DETAILS
